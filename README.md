# MLH Prep Project

Over the next 2 weeks, you'll be building a React App that works with various APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that talk to different data sources to do cool stuff.

We're using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/current) to get weather data on different cities. Your challenge over the next 2 weeks is to build out this website and add even more functionality to it. At the moment, it displays basic information about a location when you type it in. Check out [Issues](/issues) for some more ideas!

### OpenWeather API Integration
- You'll need to get your own API Key from their website (for free) 
- Add it as an environment variable in a `.env` file. We have a template available as `example.env`.

### Alan AI Integration
- We're also using [Alan AI](https://alan.app/) for voice integration. You can sign in, create a new project 
- Add this [script.txt](https://github.com/sumana2001/prep-project-4.1.3/files/7574039/message.txt) to your project in [Alan Studio](https://alan.app/docs/usage/getting-started). 
- After adding the script click on integrations button at the top right corner and get your Alan SDK Key. 
- You have to include this key in your `.env` file. We have a template available as `example.env`.

You'll be using React initially to build this. If you're new to React, check out the [website](https://reactjs.org) for some information on getting started!
